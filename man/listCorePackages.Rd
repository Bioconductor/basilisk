\usage{
listCorePackages()
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the \code{full}, a versioned package string, and \code{package}, the package name.
}
\description{
List the set of core Python packages (and their version numbers) that are provided by \pkg{basilisk}.
}
\details{
Core Python packages are usually infrastructure packages of some sort that are required by many other Python packages,
so maintaining a core installation avoids redundancy and reduces the installation footprint.
The composition of the core list is determined by the Anaconda 2019.10 package list for Python 3.7 (\url{https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/}).
Note that there are subtle differences between the package lists for different operating systems;
developers of clients of \pkg{basilisk} should avoid such OS-specific core packages.
